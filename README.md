# Tic Tac Toe Game with Python and Tkinter

This project implements a classic Tic Tac Toe (X O) game using Python's Tkinter library for the graphical user interface. The game allows a user to play against the computer, where the user plays as 'X,' and the computer responds with 'O' in random empty spots.

## Features:

- **User vs. Computer Gameplay:** Users play against the computer in a turn-based format.
- **Randomized Computer Moves:** The computer's moves are generated randomly within available empty spots.
- **User Wins:** The game detects when the user forms a winning sequence ('X') and updates the user's score accordingly.
- **Computer Wins:** If the computer forms a winning sequence ('O'), the computer's score increments, signifying its victory.
- **Tie Game:** A tie occurs when neither the user nor the computer achieves a winning sequence, leading to a drawn game.
- **Score Tracking:** The game keeps track of user and computer scores, displayed in designated labels within the interface.

## Usage:

1. Run the Python script to launch the Tic Tac Toe game.
2. Click on the empty spots to place 'X' and wait for the computer ('O') to make its move.
3. The game ends when either the user wins, the computer wins, or the game results in a tie.
4. Players can restart the game by clicking the "Restart" button to play again.

## Project Structure:

- **Main Script:** Contains the main logic and GUI setup using Tkinter.
- **Game Logic:** Implements the game's logic, including win detection and computer moves.
- **Interface Elements:** Buttons, labels, and the restart feature are designed using Tkinter.
